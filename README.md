# BKIT-Language-Compiler
This is my assignment in Principle of Programing Language subject. In this assignment, I've to build compiler for a simple language (BKIT - Bach Khoa IT).
See BKIT specification in BKIT2009 Specification-2.2.pdf

## Ass1
Write lexer and parser using ANTLR 4.0
## Ass2
Create AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
## Ass3
Write static checker. We check 12 common error, not all.
## Ass4
Write code generator (generate BKIT to Jasmin Code and run on JVM)
I just passed 79/100 testcase because I don't write code to support many dimensions array. (I can do later :>)
